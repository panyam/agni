// compile error, not a parse panic at init. Both produce the same Query the evaluator runs.

// GeneratorFirstRules reports the rules that OPEN their body with a value-producing generator whose

//
// This is the shape that makes a generated rule non-terminating rather than merely slow. The evaluator
// is a naive backtracking join running literals left to right, and `reaches` is the one built-in that
// PRODUCES values instead of filtering: given a bound start net it walks that net's series
// neighborhood, but given an unbound one it walks from EVERY net on the board. In first position
// nothing can have bound it, so the walk is unconditional. A shipped profile rule opened with
// `reaches(?n, ?rn, ?h)` and took `agni check` from 13s to not finishing at all on a real design
// (WS3-114). The fix was to lead with the guard the consuming rule already conjoined, which binds the
// start net before the walk begins.
//
// A generator whose input is a CONSTANT is fine (`reaches("VBUS", ?n, ?h)` is one walk), so only an
// unbound first argument is reported.
//
// SCOPE, stated because it is narrower than it looks. This catches the catastrophic case, not every
// bad join order. `pulled` opened with `component-on-net(?pu, ?n)`, both variables unbound, which is a
// full EDB scan re-entered per survivor: 21s rather than forever, and NOT reported here. A general
// answer is a cost-based join planner (WS3-031), not a lint. Note also what does NOT work as a guard,
// since it is the obvious first idea: requiring the first literal to share a variable with the head
// catches neither offender, because both `reaches(?n, ...)` and `component-on-net(?pu, ?n)` do mention
// the head variable. Mentioning it is not binding it.

// NonInjectiveRules reports rules whose body puts two DIFFERENT variables in the SAME argument
// position of the SAME relation without separating them, naming each offender by its head relation.
// Empty means every such pair is separated.
//
// Datalog matches by homomorphism, so two body variables may bind the same node. Circuit intent is
// almost always the opposite: a divider's two resistors must be two parts, a pull-up's rail must not
// be the net it pulls up. The language cannot say that, so an author writes a disequality by hand
// and forgetting one is neither a parse error nor a crash. It is a silently wrong verdict.
//
// The shipped case that shows the cost: the interface-presence rule derives "in use" from two
// matching signals, `has_signal(?x), has_signal(?y), ?x != ?y`. Drop that comparison and one
// matching signal satisfies "two distinct signals are present", so an interface reports itself in
// use on half the evidence and every completeness check scoped to it inherits the mistake, with
// nothing in the output saying so.
//
// SCOPE, stated because it is narrower than it looks, and deliberately so.
//
// It reports SAME-relation, SAME-position pairs only. That is the shape both shipped disequalities
// guard, and it is the one where two variables are interchangeable by construction: the relation
// says what the position means, so two variables there range over the same set. Comparing variables
// ACROSS positions or across different relations would be guesswork about sorts the query language
// does not carry.
//
// It is therefore silent on a rule like
//
//	clamped(?n) :- reaches(?n, ?rn, ?h), ?h <= 2, component-on-net(?t, ?rn), component.class(?t, "tvs")
//
// where ?n and ?rn are both nets and no disequality relates them. That is CORRECT rather than a
// miss: `reaches` is reflexive (from == to at distance zero), so a clamp on the net itself is a
// genuine answer and separating the two would break the rule. Two positions of one atom are not the
// interchangeable shape; two atoms of one relation are.
//
// Like GeneratorFirstRules it examines rule bodies, not the goal, because a goal is written per
// query by someone reading its result while a rule is authored once and consumed silently.
